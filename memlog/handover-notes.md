# Handover Notes - February 1, 2025

## Project Structure

We have two main repositories:
1. pieratdiscordbot (Discord bot)
   - Located at: e:/CODING PROJECTS/SC Name Check
   - Purpose: Basic player lookups and cargo info
   - Deployed on Railway

2. pieratwebapp (Next.js webapp)
   - Located at: e:/CODING PROJECTS/pieratwebapp
   - Purpose: Detailed reports and organization management
   - Deployed on Vercel

## Current Status

### What's Working
- Discord bot basic structure
- MongoDB connection
- Basic project setup for webapp

### Issues Encountered
1. Deployment Problems:
   - Vercel builds failing with 404s
   - Next.js configuration issues
   - Environment variables not properly propagating

2. Architecture Concerns:
   - Started with too much complexity
   - Attempted auth setup before basic functionality
   - Mixed concerns between bot and webapp

## Recommended New Approach

1. Start Simple:
   - Begin with static pages (no auth)
   - Focus on core UI/UX first
   - Use sample data initially

2. Step-by-Step Development:
   a. Basic Pages:
      - Landing page
      - Organization view
      - Report form
   
   b. Add Features:
      - Static data first
      - Then add API endpoints
      - Finally add auth
   
   c. Bot Integration:
      - Keep bot simple (lookup/cargo)
      - Add webapp links to bot responses
      - Share MongoDB models between services

3. Testing Strategy:
   - Test pages locally first
   - Verify Vercel deployment
   - Then add complexity

## Environment Setup

1. Discord Bot:
   - Keep current setup
   - Simplify to core commands

2. Webapp:
   - Start fresh with simpler Next.js setup
   - Focus on static pages first
   - Add Tailwind for styling
   - Add auth later

## Next Steps

1. Clean up webapp repository:
   - Remove auth for now
   - Focus on static pages
   - Use sample data

2. Implement core pages:
   - Landing page
   - Organization view
   - Report form

3. Once basic flow works:
   - Add MongoDB integration
   - Add Discord auth
   - Connect with bot

## Lessons Learned

1. Start Simple:
   - Get basic pages working first
   - Add complexity gradually
   - Test each step thoroughly

2. Development Flow:
   - Local development first
   - Verify deployment
   - Then add features

3. Project Organization:
   - Keep bot and webapp separate
   - Share only necessary code/models
   - Document dependencies clearly
